# OS X on Asus UX32VD
This is a working set of kexts and configurations for running OS X on an ASUS UX32VD laptop.

The purpose of this repo is to help improving an already booting system, not to help installing it: I have OS X since a long time, so I don't remember the problems I faced during installation. [Here](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/298027-guide-aio-guides-for-hackintosh/)'s a good all-in-one guide and [here](http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/forum/137-osx86-installation/)'s a specialized forum. Anyway, I have included some of the kexts I used for the installation at [Kexts for installation/](Kexts for installation/).

####System
You can find detailed hardware information gathered from Ubuntu at [System Hardware/](System Hardware/).

 - UEFI firmware version: 214
 - CPU: Intel Core i5-3317U (Ivy Bridge)
 - GPU: Intel HD4000 + Nvidia GeForce GT 620M
 - Audio: ALC269VB
 - Wifi: Dell Wireless 1520 (chipset: Broadcom BCM4322 (BCM94322HM8L))
   - _The stock wireless card doesn't work with OS X. I have replaced it with this one. Because of this, bluetooth is missing. If you need it, use AzureWave AW-CE123H as WiFi card instead (chipset: Broadcom 20702A3 (BCM20702A0) (IDs: 0x3404, 0x13d3))._

####Status
 - Current OS X version: El Capitan 10.11.6
 - Working:
   - CPU steps (XCPM enabled via Clover argument -xcpm)
   - Sleep
   - Audio
   - WiFi
   - Multitouch
   - FN keys
   - HDMI audio/video
   - ALS sensor (toggle with Fn+A, logs in /var/log/system.log)
   - Webcam
   - A lot more...
 - Not working: 
   - Card reader
   - Bluetooth (it works using an appropriate Wifi card like AzureWave AW-CE123H)
 - Unknown (not tested properly):

   - Handoff
   - Instant Hotspot
   - Hibernation
   - Nvidia GeForce GT 620M

####What's inside this repo
 - A working DSDT + SSDT: [EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched/](EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched/).
 - Instructions on how the DSDT has been made, in case you want to patch your own: [src/DSDT/](src/DSDT/). The SSDT has been generated by [ssdtPRgen](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh) v16.5: `./ssdtPRGen.sh -x 1 -lfm 900`.
 - [Clover](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/) config.plist and drivers: [EFI/CLOVER/](EFI/CLOVER).
 - The necessary kexts: [Kexts/](Kexts/). Whenever a Info.plist of these kexts has been altered, you'll find an Info.original.plist in the same directory in case you want to see the differences.
